NAME
    Geo::Fips55 - Perl extension for parsing FIPS-55 gazetteer data

SYNOPSIS
      use Geo::Fips55;

      @records = Geo::Fips55->parse_file( $filehandle );
  
      Geo::Fips55->parse_file( $filehandle, \&callback );

      $record = Geo::Fips55->new( \%data );

      $record->state_fips();
      $record->place_fips();
      $record->state();
      $record->num_counties();
      $record->crsn();
      $record->class();
      $record->name();
      $record->county_fips();
      $record->county();
      $record->part_of();
      $record->other_name();
      $record->zip();
      $record->postal_match();
      $record->zip_range();
      $record->gsa();
      $record->mrf();
      $record->msa();
      $record->cd1(); # and so on up to cd14()

DESCRIPTION
    Geo::Fips55 provides a representation of the US Geological Survey
    FIPS-55 gazetteer format. Each object is one record. It also contains
    methods to parse FIPS-55 data files and turn them into objects.

    This is intended as an intermediate format between pulling the raw data
    out of the simplistic FIPS-55 data files into something more
    sophisticated (a process you should only have to do once). As such, its
    not very fast, but its careful, easy to use and performs some
    verifications on the data being read.

    This module subclasses Michael Schwern's very nice Geo::TigerLine
    modules to do all the heavy lifting.

BUGS, CAVEATS, ETC.
    This module wasn't automatically generated like the
    Geo::TigerLine::Record::* modules were. Probably it should have been,
    but the FIPS data record layout changes even less often than the TIGER
    data -- the last revision to the FIPS-55 spec was in 1994. If it ever
    gets revised, I will gladly update this module by hand.
